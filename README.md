Graphing data using matplotlib, pandas as well as other useful imports. 

# Description

I wanted to see the inflation rate on food in other countries and was curious how other countries are doing. 

This project's purpose is to demonstrate the ability to pull external data and create 2D data as a dataframe using python.

Go to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/monthly-food-price-estimates/data to see original data source. This data was gathered by Ansh Tanwar on kaggle.com

## Getting Started

```

### Output 

This should create 5 graphs in Charts for each of the 5 stocks.
